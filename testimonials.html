        Judy's chocolate cake is fabulous. I had no ideal until I finished off my rather large slice that it contained no gluten, no diary and no eggs. It looks and tastes just like a scrumptious chocolate cake from an upscale bakery. Bravo Judy!

        I don't have celiac disease but in an effort to improve our digestion and eat healthier, my family is going gluten free. Having delicious dessert options makes this manageable plus, we don't feel deprived. Thank you Oh Crumb for fresh, delicious desserts!

        I was at a local restaurant with a friend who has celiacs and we decided to share a gluten free brownie.  I wasn't expecting much since it was gluten free, but the waiter (who I know) recommended it.  It was actually the best brownie I ever had.  He gave me the contact details of the maker (Oh Crumb) and for my baby shower I had them cater it.  We ordered a few trays of the brownie (just as delicious as I remembered!), banana bread, angel food cake, and cake.  They were all amazing!  No one at the shower could believed they were gluten free.  I'd definitely use them again and recommend to anyone with or without gluten sensitive diets.

        I found the lasagna very tasty and with a great consistency.  You could tell it was hand made fresh pasta! Would certainly purchase this product again!

        Recently, I had the privilege of enjoying one of Judy's dinners.  Her lasagna was fabulous - just the right amount of seasoning and lots of delicious cheeses.  I actually ate twice as much as I normally do.  Anyone who wants gluten-free food will absolutely love this dish.  It tastes homemade (well, it IS handmade) and is by far the best lasagna I have eaten in years.
        Dessert, also gluten-free, was a wonderful concoction of light, airy angel food cake with lemon and whipped cream.  Again, it was SO good, with a clean, refreshing taste.
        I highly recommend Judy's gluten-free creations!
