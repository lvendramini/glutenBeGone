        Judy's chocolate cake is fabulous. I had no ideal until I finished off my rather large slice that it contained no gluten, no diary and no eggs. It looks and tastes just like a scrumptious chocolate cake from an upscale bakery. Bravo Judy!

        I don't have celiac disease but in an effort to improve our digestion and eat healthier, my family is going gluten free. Having delicious dessert options makes this manageable plus, we don't feel deprived. Thank you Oh Crumb for fresh, delicious desserts!

        I was at a local restaurant with a friend who has celiacs and we decided to share a gluten free brownie.  I wast expecting it be pretty plain since it was gluten free, but the waiter (who I know) recommended it.  It was actually the best brownie I ever had.  He gave me the contact details of the maker (Oh Crumb) and for my baby shower I had them cater it.  We ordered a few trays of the brownie (just as delicious as I remembered!), banana bread, angel food cake, and cake.  They were all amazing!  No one at the shower could believed they were gluten free.  I'd definitely use them again and recommend to anyone with or without gluten sensitive diets.
