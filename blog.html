                    Many health-conscious people toy with the idea of giving up gluten. Why? If you haven’t been diagnosed with celiac disease or as gluten sensitive - why give up gluten?
                    <br/><br/>
                    There’s an estimated 99% of individuals who are gluten intolerant or actually have celiac disease that have not been diagnosed. Estimates indicate that as many as 1 in 30 individuals are sensitive to gluten. If you fall into that category your immune system will send antibodies out to attack gluten particles. On a molecular level the protein Gliadin in gluten is very similar to your body’s own tissues - this attack can therefore affect your skin, your thyroid or even your brain, this is called molecular mimicry.  
                    <br/><br/>
                    Gluten can cause your body to attack itself which may cause problems like rheumatoid arthritis or autoimmune thyroid to name a few.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Everyone wants nice skin, free of acne. The inflammation that gluten can cause affects your hormones, namely the stress hormone cortisol. Too much cortisol in your system can cause acne along with other problems like weight gain and poor sleep!
                    In addition a healthy brain requires a healthy gut. We make a neurotransmitter called serotonin. You may have heard of it, it regulates your mood and when serotonin is low, you could feel depressed. Gluten is poorly digested and damages the gut. Undigested food particles can linger in your intestines and feed bacteria and yeast. This overgrowth can suppress your production of serotonin which can cause mood imbalances like anxiety, irritability and mood swings. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Are you sensitive to gluten?
                    <br/><br/>
                    Try eliminating gluten from your diet for at least a month, then re-introduce it and see how you feel, how your skin looks and if you are trying to lose weight, is it working?
                    <br/><br/>
                    Oh Crumb! desserts make eliminating gluten from your diet so much easier with no deprivation.

                    Our desire to avoid gluten is taking a fairly wide range of health conscious individuals by storm. Why are so many people going to such lengths to avoid gluten in their daily life?
                    <br/><br/>
                    Many individuals seem to understand that your health and your diet are intertwined. There’s more and more information explaining how to fix symptoms like headaches, fatigue or stomach cramps without the use of drugs. Many people with a headache are beginning to understand that they’re not deficient in aspirin but…there’s another underlying cause. This is not to say that when symptoms persist you shouldn’t get your doctors opinion but it’s easy to eliminate foods that we now know can cause problems in a growing number of individuals and see how you feel. It’s easy, inexpensive and you have nothing to lose other than - your headache. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Anyone can follow a gluten-free lifestyle now-a-days and the manufacturers are more than happy to comply. There’s a variety of reasons why so many people have decided to go gluten-free. The most serious reason is someone who’s been diagnosed with celiac disease - they have to avoid gluten the rest of their life. But what about proactive individuals who want to avoid “developing celiac”…that’s a very  compelling reason. The key is to do it right, to protect your health you need to cut out all gluten and adopt an eating style that you can live with and enjoy.Both men and women are at risk for celiac disease. People of any age or race can develop this autoimmune condition. However, there are some factors that can increase your risk of developing celiac disease, namely 1st or 2nd degree relatives with celiac disease.

                    That’s why my company - Gluten Be Gone has developed a brand of desserts - Oh Crumb! that makes living a gluten-free lifestyle possible - you or anyone in your family should never feel deprived or left out. Dessert is not only possible but truly delicious. I now see friends and family feeling so much better knowing they’re taking control of their health and developing new habits that support a healthy lifestyle.

                    Imagine for a minute mixing flour and water, what would you get, a sticky, spongy mixture. Then if you add some salt, yeast and some fat - voila! - you end up with an elastic dough. Gluten is a protein composite that’s found in grassy grains like wheat, barley and rye. It’s this gluten composite that takes you from adding dry and wet ingredients together into the stretchy dough you end up with. When this protein is mixed with liquid you create an elastic matrix, when you add yeast this gluten matrix captures bubbles of carbon dioxide because the yeasts ferment and the dough then rises. So…now you have a loaf of bread, doesn’t sound too bad does it?
                    <br/><br/>
                    So what’s the problem?
                    <br/><br/>
                    Back in the day wheat grew wild. Humans saw ruminants grazing on grasses and decided to save the seeds and plant them which began the cultivation of wheat, rye and barley. Wheat today is completely different from the wheat we ate back in the day. First of all, it is processed differently. New techniques in grain processing in the late 19th century made it possible to create massive amounts of refined wheat for a low cost.  Almost all of the wheat eaten today is high-yield dwarf wheat, which was developed by cross-breeding and crude genetic manipulation around the year 1960. Dwarf wheat has shorter stems and a much greater yield. Therefore it is much, much cheaper than the older varieties and more economically feasible. The benefits of a high-yield crop are obvious, but we are now learning that there were some major downsides to this as well. Specifically, modern wheat has some subtle but important differences in its nutrient and protein composition.

                    The problem with this great idea is that humans eating gluten in these grains are very poorly digested. As the gluten moves through your small intestines it’s broken down into enzymes. This is OK so far but, in some people with a particular genetic code, this process can trigger a harmful reaction in their intestines. This reaction is where some individuals end up with celiac disease.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In your small intestine you have these little hair-like projections called villi. These villi are very important to good health, they absorb the nutrients from the food you eat. The gluten in grains damages this very important villi and you are no longer able to absorb your nutrients - the nutrients in your food just move through your damaged intestines unabsorbed rather than being caught up in the shag-like carpet we know as your villi.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Millions of individuals are walking around with digestive problems, bouts of diarrhea, stomach pain, bloating and gas, skin rashes, brain and nervous system disorders not realizing they have celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
