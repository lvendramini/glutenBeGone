        <div style="width: 80%; padding-left: 10%">
            In the winter of 2009, I took a cake decorating course, but having been diagnosed with Celiac disease,
            and only eating gluten free food, I thought I could bake and decorate regular cakes and serve them to my
            family and friends to enjoy – the creative part was the fun part for me! Then I started to experiment with
            family recipes, making them gluten free.
            <br/><br/>
            I took my cake decorating skills and my gluten-free lifestyle and developed an array of fabulous
            desserts that you wouldn't be able to tell are gluten-free – desserts and entrees that not only my
            friends and family would love but, that being Celiac, I could enjoy as well.
            <br/><br/>
            Everyone deserves a little decadence in their busy life. Gluten-free food has come a long way in the
            last 20 years but still those who have Celiac or are gluten-intolerant or simply want to avoid gluten
            still have to go into the freezer section to purchase desserts.
            My mission from the beginning was not only to develop a great tasting collection of desserts and entrees that were gluten-free,
            but also were FRESH (not frozen), were made from scratch with high quality ingredients, contained no preservatives,
            artificial flavourings, colouring, fillers or additives.
